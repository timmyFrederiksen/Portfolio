This app was made by a group of people and me in my high school iOS Development class! It was our big project and took us around half of the semester to plan, develop and launch the app to the App Store.


It's an app for our school to get information to students in a more effective, modern fashion. Students can find extra-curicullar activities, recieve announcements, and much more.
